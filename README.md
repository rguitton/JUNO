# JUNO

## Get use with our project



## If during the execution of the  ``make`` command, you got an error, follow these steps :

- do ``which root`` to find the root directory of your ROOT installation, copy this path
  - for me, it is `/snap/bin/root`
- do `ls -a ~` to see the `.bashrc` file, open this file and add this line 
- do `export ROOTSYS=/snap/bin/root`
